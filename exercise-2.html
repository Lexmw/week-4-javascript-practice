  <h1>Math in JavaScript</h1>
  <p> If there is one thing computers do well, it's math! Let's try adding, subtracting, mulitiplying and even dividing.
    There is also a way to take the remainder. The opperators for this are: + - * / and %, respectively. </p>
</body>

<h3> Examples </h3>
<p>
  One plus one is
  <script>
    document.write(1 + 1);
  </script>
</p>
<p>
  Two times two is
  <script>
    document.write(2 * 2);
  </script>
</p>
<p>
  1/3 is
  <script>
    document.write(1 / 3);
  </script>
</p>
<p>
  the remainder of 11/3 is
  <script>
    document.write(11 % 3);
  </script>
</p>
<p>
  1 plus 500 times 8 divided by 4 minus 1 is
  <script>
    document.write((1 + 500) * 8 / 4 - 1);
  </script>
</p>

<h3>You Try it!</h3>

<p>
  Now you try to fill in the <code>document.write();</code> statements, below. Then write 5 more of your own, for a
  total of 8!
</p>

<p>One hundred plus one million is
  <script>
    document.write(100+1,000,000);
  </script>
</p>
<p>1024 divided by 16 is
  <script>
    document.write(1024/16);
  </script>
</p>
<p>4 plus 4 plus 9 all divided by 6 is
  <script>
    document.write(4+4+9/6);
  </script>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Now you write 5 more statements of your own.
  </strong>
</p>

<p> 7 plus 6 plus is
</script>
  document.write(7+6);
</script>
</p>
<p>100 divide by 15 is 
  document.write(100/15);
</script>
</p>
<p>34 plus 5 plus 4 is
  document.write(34+5+4);
</script>
</p>
<p>56 divide by 800 is
  document.write(56/800);
</script>
</p>
<p>4 plus 20 divide 5 is 
  document.write(4+20/5)
</script>
</p>
